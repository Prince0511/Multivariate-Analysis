Source of dataset:

The dataset was collectively generated by the entire class and comprises information on social media app usage on a weekly basis, including the frequency of app openings.
The data collection process relied on manual tracking, as mobile phones maintain records of app usage duration. 
The ultimate goal of the dataset was to determine whether individuals are addicted to social media or not, based on the frequency of app openings. 
A threshold of 105 app openings was established as the criterion for making the determination of addiction/non-addiction.

Questions that I tried to answer (Hypothesis):

1. How time spent on social media reveals underlying pattern on addiction?
2. Are we able to distinguish between different peopleâ€™s choices based on the time spent on app?
3. Does time spent on each app really counts towards person's being addicted?
