### 🔍 Diabetes Dataset: Predictive Analysis 📊

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

### 📚 Data Dictionary:
- Pregnancies -> This field represents the number of times a person has been pregnant. It is a discrete variable with integer values ranging from 0 to a positive integer.

- Glucose -> This field represents the glucose level (measured in mg/dL) of the person. It is a continuous variable with numeric values representing the person's blood glucose concentration.

- Blood Pressure -> This field represents the glucose level (measured in mg/dL) of the person. It is a continuous variable with numeric values representing the person's blood glucose concentration.

- Skin Thickness	-> This field represents the skin thickness (measured in mm) of the person. It is a continuous variable with numeric values representing the thickness of the skin at a particular location on the body.	

- Insulin -> This field represents the insulin level (measured in mu U/ml) of the person. It is a continuous variable with numeric values representing the person's insulin concentration.

- BMI -> This field represents the Body Mass Index (BMI) of the person. It is a continuous variable with numeric values representing the person's BMI.

- Diabetes Pedigree Function -> This field represents a function that scores the diabetes history of the person's ancestors. It is a continuous variable with numeric values representing the person's diabetes pedigree function score.

- Age	-> This field represents the age (in years) of the person. It is a discrete variable with integer values representing the person's age.

- Outcome	-> This field represents the outcome of the person's diabetes diagnosis. It is a binary variable with values 0 or 1, where 0 indicates no diabetes and 1 indicates diabetes.

### 🔍 Hypothesis:

#### Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 🧮:

- 📉 How many variables can we reduce to using PCA?
- 📊 Can we identify the contribution of different features towards the overall variability or explained variance in the diabetes dataset?

#### Clustering Analysis 🗺️:

- 🧩 Does clustering analysis help identify any patterns in the dataset, such as differences in glucose level, age, or insulin?

#### Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) 🔍:

- 📈 Can we reduce the number of factors using EFA by identifying the minimum number of factors that capture the majority of the dataset's variance?

#### Multiple Regression 📊:

- 📅 Can we predict a person's age using Multiple Regression based on features like pregnancies, glucose, insulin, etc.?

#### Logistic Regression 📈:

- 🩺 Can we predict a person's outcome (diabetic or non-diabetic) using Logistic Regression based on features like glucose, insulin, age, etc.?

### 📜 Supporting Evidence:
